## Why These Didn't Auto-Match

The migration name-matching couldn't find exact matches because:
- **Cooking methods eliminated**: New DB prefers raw versions
- **Specificity reduced**: "Grade A Large eggs" → "Egg, whole"
- **Frozen/prepared eliminated**: New DB prefers fresh versions
- **Specialty variants consolidated**: Many types → generic version
